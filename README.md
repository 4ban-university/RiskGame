# Development
Open project in Intellij Idea and run Launcher via default build configuration.

# Contribution
The master branch is made secure to avoid errors (i.e. protected), so you are not able to push directly to master branch.

Steps to contribute:
* Clone the project to your PC
* Create new branch with adequate name following the convention 
    Bad names: new-branch, branch1, sucker
    Good names: [issue number]-[description] or [verb-description] i.g. 3-save-game or 2-load-map or add-map-editor
    Perfect names: [grouping token]/[well-defined token] i.g. mapeditor/tests or mapeditor/patch-1 or mapeditor/feature-gui
* Do some work
* Commit your changes
* Push your changes to the remote repository (i.e. Github) into **your branch**
* Create a pull request **from your branch** **to master branch** and assign others as reviewers
